# golden cookie clicker

This game is a tribute to an old childhood favorite of mine. I created it to showcase my skills in Swift and challenge myself in coding. The challenge was to create a "mini game" using a programming language that is not typically used for game development, and I successfully achieved it.

Playing the game is simple. You just need to click the rotating cookie in the center of the screen to earn money. After collecting money, you can use it to upgrade the click per money ratio, money per spin ratio (yes, you also earn money after the cookie completes one full circle), or spin speed. As you progress, you will unlock achievements, which can be accessed through the menu.

* I may consider this game as a done project even though it is not, I may or may not commit changes to it because it is an old project of mine, I wanted to add leaderboard which is fetching money data from firebase and maybe I will in the future or maybe not. also firebase login may be broken because it is outdated.
